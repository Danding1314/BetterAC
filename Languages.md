# Custom Language Support

Do you want to add your own language? 

Or do you want to modify messages? 

if you go to `plugin_data/BetterAC` you should find a folder called `languages`.

In this folder are all languages, by default `eng.yml`.

## How to create your own Language or modify messages?

1. Copy the content of `eng.yml` in the file, you need.

2. Call your file like the language + `.yml` .

3. Paste the copied content of `eng.yml` in your new file.

4. Translate / edit the messages you want and save it

5. Go to `config.yml` and edit `language:` to the file you created :warning: But **NOT** with `.yml` file extension
